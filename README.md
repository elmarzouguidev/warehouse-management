### stuff

- Admins: Admins will likely have the highest level of access and will be responsible for managing the system as a whole. They might perform actions such as adding new users, modifying system settings, and viewing reports. 

- Regular users: Regular users will likely have access to most of the features of the system, but will not have the same level of access as admins. They might perform actions such as managing orders, processing deliveries, and viewing inventory levels. 

- Customers: Customers will likely be able to view their orders and delivery status, as well as place new orders. You might consider creating a CustomerController to handle these actions.

You might also consider adding a changed_at column to store the date and time of each status change.

- Alert:

With this approach, each product is assigned a unique barcode, which can be scanned when it is added to or removed from the warehouse. This can help you keep track of your inventory levels and locate items more quickly.

These are just a few examples of the types of controllers that you might consider for your project. You can also create additional controllers as needed to handle other actions or functionality.
